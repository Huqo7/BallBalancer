log2.csv - Integral seems low, overshoot when new setpoints
kp = 0.045
ki = 0.05
kd = 0.0375

log3.csv - Growing sinusoidal motion due to higher integral - reduce prop
kp = 0.03
ki = 0.15
kd = 0.0375

log4.csv - Sinusoidal motion with same amplitude until new setpoint - removing kd and halfing ki
kp = 0.03
ki = 0.15
kd = 0#0.0375

log5.csv - Smoother motion, needs derivative to stop higher velocities - introducing kd back
kp = 0.03
ki = 0.075
kd = 0.01

log6.csv - More stable, still too little kd
kp = 0.03
ki = 0.075
kd = 0.01

log7.csv - Growing sinusoidal motion, upping kd
kp = 0.03
ki = 0.075
kd = 0.015

log8.csv - Sinusoidal motion with same amplitude - upping kp
kp = 0.03
ki = 0.075
kd = 0.02

log9.csv - Very stable and precise however large changes in setpoint creates critical instability -
attempting to reduce the windup guard
kp = 0.04
ki = 0.075
kd = 0.02
